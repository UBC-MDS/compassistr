#' @title dry_calc
#' @description Calculates probability of at least one occurence of an event given the number of attempts.
#'
#' @param p Probability of event occurence.
#' @param n The number of attempts.
#' @param verbose Controls format of returned probability. Default (TRUE) returns result as a chr statement; FALSE returns result as a numeric.
#' @param plot Controls return of plot showing where the resulting probability lies on the binomial distribution. Default (TRUE) shows the plot.
#'
#' @return A number, the probability of at least one occurrence of event given the number of trials as a decimal (if verbose set to FALSE).
